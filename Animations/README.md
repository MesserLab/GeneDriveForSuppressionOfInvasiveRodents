# Animated heamtap graphs

This folder contains several graphs showing how a 2d slice from the parameter space changes in response to a third parameter changing.
For all these animations, all parameters not graphed are kept at their default values:

- Density: 1000.0
- Island side length: 2.0
- Interaction distance: 75.0
- Avg. dispersal: 250.0
- Monthly survival rate: 0.9
- Litter size: 4.0
- Itinerant frequency: 0.1
- Itin. dispersal multiplier: 2.0
- Release Percentage: 0.1
- Drive fitness: 1.0
- Drive efficiency: 0.9
- Resistance rate: 0.0
- R1 rate: 0.0
