    "## 1. Loading a model\n",
    "First, load the model and check model predictions are against the default testing set via the check_accuracy function. A different test set can be specified as a parameter of the check_accuracy function.\n",
    "\n",
    "The load_model function has three arguments: model_name, model_type, and force_cpu.\n",
    "\n",
    "Five models are available to specify via model_name:\n",
    "- \"female_fertility_homing\"\n",
    "- \"female_fertility_homing_resistance\"\n",
    "- \"viability_homing\"\n",
    "- \"viability_homing_resistance\"\n",
    "- \"y_shredder\"\n",
    "\n",
    "For each of these, two model_type settings are available:\n",
    "- \"composite\"\n",
    "- \"suppression_rate\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"suppression_rate\" models are slightly more accurate, but have much looser confidence bounds, which may make the \"composite\" model more suitable for plotting purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code will automatically detect whether or not a CUDA enabled GPU is available to accelerate the model. To prevent the model from using your GPU if you have one, add \"force_cpu=True\" to the function call. There is no reason to do this unless you're doing some other computing work with your GPU or if you get a GPU out of memory error.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Gaussian processes are stochastic. Loading the model requires that the model undergo a single training iteration on the test data, which is done internally by the function. This means that the loading function is also stochastic, and the model can vary from load to load by a very small amount."
