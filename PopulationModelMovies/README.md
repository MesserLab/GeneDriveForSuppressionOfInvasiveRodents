# Population model movies


This folder contains several movies generated using the the population model.
One animation per drive uses the default values for the parameters, with the drive efficiency specified in each file name:
- Density: 1000.0
- Island side length: 2.0
- Interaction distance: 75.0
- Avg. dispersal: 250.0
- Monthly survival rate: 0.9
- Litter size: 4.0
- Itinerant frequency: 0.1
- Itin. dispersal multiplier: 2.0
- Release Percentage: 0.1
- Drive fitness: 1.0
- Resistance rate: 0.0
- R1 rate: 0.0


One animation per drive uses an alternate set of values for the parameters, which shows substantially different model behavior:
- Density: 800.0
- Island side length: 2.5
- Interaction distance: 60.0
- Avg. dispersal: 100.0
- Monthly survival rate: 0.8
- Litter size: 3.0
- Itinerant frequency: 0.1
- Itin. dispersal multiplier: 2.0
- Release Percentage: 0.1
- Drive fitness: 1.0
- Resistance rate: 0.0
- R1 rate: 0.0


For each simulation, the drive efficiency is configured to within 1 or 2 percent of the minimum required efficiency to suppress the population.


For the homing drives, white dots represent wild type homozygotes, cyan dots represent drive/wild type heterozygotes, and purple dots represent drive homozygotes.


For the y-shredder, blue dots and brown dots represent wild type males and females respectively; cyan dots and red dots represent drive carrying males and drive carrying females respectively.
